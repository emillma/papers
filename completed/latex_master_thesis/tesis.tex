\chapter{Conclusion}
In this \master I have successfully finished the development of a \sr capable of capturing synchronized stereo data from two polarization cameras.
Using \gls{cuda} and \gls{gstreamer} I have achieved on-the-fly hardware-accelerated video compression on the \jx, which enables the recording of longer data sets.
In addition to this, the \sr is now easy to use for anyone, thanks to the new web-based \gls{gui} and 3D printed ergonomic handles.

Completing the \sr has been a challenging but rewarding process where I have acquired many new skills.
Based on the experience I have gained, I can say that designing and building a \sr is a non-trivial and time-consuming task that should be avoided if existing datasets are sufficient for the task at hand.

The \sr provides a combination of sensor data that is believed to be unique and valuable for future research.
My supervisor, Annette Stahl, and I have started planning a scientific paper presenting this new type of data set and how stereo polarization cameras can be used to enhance situational awareness in the maritime domain.

The achievements of this \master are expected to be an excellent starting point for my future Ph.D. work and be used in several other projects at NTNU.
