\chapter{Improving Ergonomics and Mechanical Rigidity}
\label{chap:hardware}

After the \preproject most of the hardware was already in place, but some parts were missing.
I applied for funding and purchased a new 3D printer to enable an iterative design process.
With this in place, custom ergonomic carry handles, new combined camera and antenna mounts, and other minor parts were designed and 3D-printed.
