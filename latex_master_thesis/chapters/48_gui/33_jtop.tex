\subsection{Jtop Page}
\label{sec:gui_jtop}
\gls{jtop} is a monitoring and control tool specifically designed for \gls{jetson} systems \cite{bonghiJtopRbonghiJetson}.
To enhance its usability, \gls{gui} page was developed, displaying valuable information from \gls{jtop} about the \jx system's status.
This includes power consumption, input voltage (which can be used to monitor the battery level), and various temperatures to prevent overheating, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:gui_jtop}.
The \gls{gui} page also facilitates the monitoring of data processing by providing insights into \gls{gpu}, \gls{cpu}, \gls{ram}, and encoder usage.
