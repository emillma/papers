\chapter*{Preface}

This \master's thesis is part of my integrated Ph.D. program at NTNU, where I focus on enhancing multi-sensor detection for \gls{asv}.
My Ph.D. work is funded by SFI Autoship, a research center for autonomous ships.

Throughout this project, I have had the opportunity to explore diverse topics with which I have had limited prior experience.
The process of learning new things has been enjoyable, albeit challenging at times.
In hindsight, I see that I might have been overly ambitious but I feel proud as I have managed to complete all the objectives I set out to achieve.

I am grateful to several individuals who have provided technical, academic, and emotional support during this journey.
Firstly, I would like to thank my supervisor, Annette Stahl, for her guidance and proofreading of the final draft.
Additionally, my co-supervisors, Edmund Førland Brekke and Rudolf Mester, have offered valuable feedback throughout the semester.
I would also like to thank my colleagues at Nyhavna for being excellent discussion partners and formidable ping-pong opponents.
My family has given unwavering support and stern reminders to enjoy the sun outside the office, which I am grateful for.

Finally and most importantly, I would like to thank my soon-to-be wife, Tale Søfting, for her patience and warm hugs when I returned home from long days of segfaults and compilation errors.
