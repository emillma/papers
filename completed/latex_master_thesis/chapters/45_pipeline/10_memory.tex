\section{Memory Movement in the Pipeline}
Figure \ref{fig:pipeline_current} shows an overview of the memory movement in the current pipeline.
Work was put into minimizing the memory movement in the pipeline, yet there are still some redundant copies as shown in the figure.
How to remove these redundant copies is further discussed in Section \ref{sec:memory_pipeline_improvements}.
