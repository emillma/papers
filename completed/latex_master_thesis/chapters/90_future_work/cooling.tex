\section{Cooling}
Section 8.5 of the \preproject discussed concerns regarding potential overheating of the \sr due to inadequate heat dissipation through the enclosure walls.
To address this potential issue, a liquid cooling block was procured from Connect Tech Inc., and preliminary sketches were created to explore its potential installation within the \sr, in case it became necessary.

However, after analyzing the data provided by the \textit{jtop} tab, presented in Section \ref{sec:gui_jtop}, during a longer operation, it was determined that the current cooling solution proved to be sufficient for operational requirements as the of the \gls{cpu} and \gls{gpu} remained below $65^{\circ}C$.
If the inside of the enclosure reaches this temperature, it might however damage the lifetime of the battery.
It should also be noted that under extreme conditions such as prolonged exposure to direct daylight on a hot summer day, the current cooling capacity might be insufficient.

A small temporary safety measure that is planned as a par of  the new \gls{navbox} interface is to publish the temperature from the \gls{pico}, which should be close to the temperature inside the box \cite[71]{PicoSDK}.
This will then be used to warn the user if the temperature is too high and shut down the system if it reaches a critical level for the battery.
