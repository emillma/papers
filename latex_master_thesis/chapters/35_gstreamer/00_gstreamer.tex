\chapter{Video Compression using GStreamer}
\label{chap:gstreamer}

As discussed in Section \ref{sec:intro:compression}, there are several motivations for enabling on-the-fly compression of the video data on the \sr.
This chapter explains how \gls{gstreamer} is used to compress the video streams in real-time using hardware acceleration on the \jx.
It also covers how \gls{pygo} is used to interact with the \gls{gstreamer} pipeline from Python.
