  abstract = {This chapter addresses a series of issues that are amongst the most rewarding, but also the most fraught and the most difficult with which to deal. They are: authorship, co-authoring, and sharing data. The benefits, pitfalls and perils of collaborating are explored. Every academic will have a different approach to dealing with these matters. Deciding early on in your career how you are going to manage these requests from others to co-author will help you avoid some of the perils, while capitalising on the enormous benefits of working with someone you respect and trust. The rules of authorship are explored along with protocols that will help you to avoid being `ripped off', mistreated and having the wool pulled over your eyes by someone who has more power than you or who mounts a seemingly convincing argument as to why their name should go first on a co-authored article, when you did all the hard intellectual slog associated with it. It explores the general principles of fairness, recognition of intellectual input and being ethical when co-authoring. This chapter explains the importance of being aware of and familiarising yourself with your institution's policies and procedures when it comes to co-authoring. Being able to cite the relevant policies and procedures can be of great assistance when dealing with problematic co-authors.},

  abstract = {There has been an increase in the number of journal articles that are co-authored by researchers who claim to have made equal contributions. This growth has sparked discussions in the literature, especially within medical journals. To extend the debate beyond medical disciplines and support journal editors in forming an opinion, the current review collates and explores published viewpoints about so-called Equal Co-authorship (EC) practices. The Web of Science core database was used to identify publications that mention and discuss EC. Within the limited number of publications that were found on the Web of Science database, the most-cited item was used to trace other papers that discuss EC. In total, 39 papers (including articles and editorials) met the inclusion criteria. This review identifies four main themes within the sample including the growth of EC, challenges of attributing EC, guidelines and policies about EC and gender issues in the attribution of EC. Based on the survey and analysis of publications that discuss EC, this review provides recommendations regarding journal policy statements, and EC indicators. Those recommendations include: (1) journal policies should address EC; and (2) use should be made of available functionalities (CRediT, for example) to capture and indicate equal contributions.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: To determine the prevalence of honorary and ghost authorship in Cochrane reviews, how authorship is assigned, and the ways in which authors and Cochrane editorial teams contribute. METHODS: Using a Web-based, self-administered survey, corresponding authors for 577 reviews published in issues 1 and 2 from 1999 of The Cochrane Library were invited to report on the prevalence of honorary and ghost authors, contributions by authors listed in the byline and members of Cochrane editorial teams, and identification of methods of assigning authorship. Responses were received for 362 reviews (63\% response rate), which contained 913 authors. RESULTS: One hundred forty-one reviews (39\%) had evidence of honorary authors, 32 (9\%) had evidence of ghost authors (most commonly a member of the Cochrane editorial team), and 9 (2\%) had evidence of both honorary and ghost authors. The editorial teams contributed in a wide variety of ways to 301 reviews (83\%). Authorship was decided by the group of authors (31\%) or lead author (25\%) in most reviews. Authorship order was assigned according to contribution in most reviews (76\%). The 3 functions contributed to most by those listed in the byline were assessing the quality of included studies (83\%), interpreting data (82\%), and abstracting data from included studies (77\%). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of reviews had evidence of honorary and ghost authorship. The Cochrane editorial teams contributed to most Cochrane reviews.},

  abstract = {Co-authorship of papers is very common in most areas of science, and it has increased as the complexity of research has strengthened the need for scientific collaboration. But the fact that papers have more than an author tends to complicate the attribution of merit to individual scientists. I argue that collaboration does not necessarily entail co-authorship, but that in many cases the latter is an option that individual authors might not choose, at least in principle: each author might publish in a separate way her own contribution to the collaborative project in which she has taken part, or papers could explicitly state what the contribution of each individual author has been. I ask, hence, why it is that scientists prefer to `pool' their contributions instead of keeping them separate, if what they pursue in their professional careers (besides epistemic goals) is individual recognition. My answer is based on the view of the scientific paper as a piece of argumentation, following an inferentialist approach to scientific knowledge. A few empirical predictions from the model presented here are suggested in the conclusions.},
