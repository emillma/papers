\section{Migrating to Jetson Orin}
As we have ordered a \jo migration to this platform will be performed in the future.
With the compilation and flashing scripts in place, compiling the latest version of JetPack and flashing the \jo should be simplified, but will probably still take a couple of tries.
The current preprocessing implementation in\gls{cuda} is partially designed arount limited amound shared memory on the \jx \gls{gpu}, which will no longer be necessary on the \jo, making it possible to process each fram on a single \gls{sm}.
