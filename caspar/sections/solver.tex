\section{Solver Design}
Basacally just a copy of BAL.
Uses the same dampening update as everyone else.
Tried using \gls{cudss}

\subsection{Early Termination of PCGNR}
Unsucessfull steps are a waste of time.
Cost of \gls{pcgnr} iterations are significant compared to the cost of uptading estimates and evaluating the real cost function.
Check at regular intervls if we the real cost in decreasing.

Issue: Can lead to a low dampening factor and short steps.

\subsection{Kernel Fusion}
Every step of \gls{pcgnr} uses custiom \cuda kernels generated by \caspar
