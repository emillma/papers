\section*{Synchronization}
The \gls{imu} samples at a fixed frequency following an internal clock \cite{safranSTIM300Datasheet}.
When a trigger signal is received, the \gls{imu} sends the latest available data, together with the trigger count and the delay between the trigger and the time of capture \cite{safranSTIM300Datasheet}.
At a varying interval, a trigger signal is sent to the \gls{imu} and a \gls{f9p} receiver simultaneously, causing the \gls{f9p} to log the time of the trigger \cite[190]{u-bloxZEDF9PInterfaceDescription}.
This message is used to synchronize the \gls{imu} to \gls{utc}.
By systematically varying the interval and delaying the trigger signal by a couple of microseconds the association of the \gls{imu} message to the \gls{tm2} message is ensured.

The cameras support \gls{ptp} synchronization, but


\subsection*{IMU}
Microcontroller send interrupt to F9P and log TM2 messages.
Variable frequency to ensure synchronization if messages are lost.

\subsection*{Cameras}
Use cameras and network card that support PTP.
