\section*{Utilization Plan}
\subsection*{Problem / Solution}
I started my pitch by asking the audience to raise a hand if they depend in data to pertorm their research.
With 100\% of the audience raising their hand it is clear that data is a crucial part of research.
The type of data each researcher needs varies, of course, but in the field of robotics and autonomy almost every researcher needs to work with some sort of sensor data.
With this in mind, I have developped a sensor rig, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:operation}, to make it easier for researchers to perform data collection.
The sensor rig is designed for easy transport and operation by a single individual, and can also be temporarily attached to an existing vessel, making it versatile for a wide range of data collection scenarios.
As accurate positioning and synchronazation is key for any high quality dataset the sensor rig is equipped with two GNSS receivers and an IMU and everything is synchronized to UTC.
The sensor rig provides for separate gigabit ethernet ports with PoE to connect various sensors.
A custom web app is developed to control and monitor the sensor rig from a smartphone, making it easy to operate for almost anyone.
The fact that multiple different people have used the sensor sig with mimimal training is a testament to its usability.
At the end of the pitch I asked for funding hire a student over the summer to help developing the sensor rig further and use it collect data.
From holding a similar pitches in the past did get funding to hire not one but two students, signalling that the audience sees the potential in the sensor rig.

From the pitching panel I goot good feedback on the pitch, but they pointed out that my ask could be formulated more clarly.

\subsection*{Benefits}
From a users perspective, the key benefit of the sensor rig is its ease of use.
Research teams working in autonomy often rely on expensive research vehicles, such as the autonomous ferry Milliampere 2 to do their research.
These vehicles can be used to collect data, but it can be overkill and their operation often requires planning and coordination between multiple people.
If anything fails on the vehicle, even things not connected to data collection, such as a morot, the vehicle is generally taken out of operation

With the sensor rig, a single person can just pick it up, walk outside and start collecting data in a matter of minutes.
With its modular and stand alone desagn, it is also easy to attach it to an existing vehicle to temporarily create a pseudo research vehicle or expand the capabilities of an existing one.
Compared to any research vehicle, the sensor rig is also much cheaper, making it more accessible to smaller research teams.

\subsection*{Maret potential}
If the sensor rig was to be commercialized, it would be targeted towards small to medium sized research teams working in autonomy, as larger teams probably have dedicated hardware engineers to develop custom solutions.
A popential product would be the bare bone sensor rig equipped only with GNSS receivers an IMU and a the core computer.
Different brackets for attaching various sensors could be sold separately, as well as fully equipped versions with cameras and other sensors.
As the sensors used for researhing autonomy are generally expensive, having an easy way to use them as much as possible is valuable.
From personal experience I know researhers often have expensive sensors lying around that they do not use due to low usability.

The market potenteal for the sensor rig remains to be researched, but I believe there is a market for a product like this based on feedback from other researchers.

\subsection*{Existing competition}
I have not done a market analysis, but I am not aware of any similar product on the market.
One related prodct is the ZED-box from Stereolabs which can be used to collect data from multiple ZED cameras and synchronize them to UTC \cite{stereolabsZEDBoxEmbedded}. 
This is not a competitor to the sensor rig, but shows that there is a market for easy to use sensor synchronization systems.
Another related product is the SentiBoard from SentiSystems which handles synchronization of multiple sensors and can be used to calculate accurate position and orientation from GNSS and IMU data \cite{sentisystemsSentiSystemsSolutions}.
Both the ZED-box and the SentiBoard appear to be more aimed at the industrial market, and are not as versatile as the sensor rig.

\subsection*{Milestones}
The first milestone for the sensor rig was to develop a prototype and test it in a real research setting.
This milestone was reached in 2024, and the sensor rig has since been in use to collect data.
I submitted a paper describing the sensor rig to the ICMASS conference in 2024 and will present it there if accepted.
This is the next milestone will be a good opportunity to get feedback from the research community and to get the sensor rig known.

The following goal is to use the data from the sensor rig in my future publications and having other researchers use it in their research as well, proving the value of the sensor rig in a research setting.
Hopefully, when I finish my PhD in two years, the sensor rig will have a proven track record and be ready for commercialization.

If I decide to pursue commercialization, the next milestone would be to sell a couple units to other research teams and provide good customer support to get feedback on the product.
This should not require much investment nor time and can be done as a side job if I reduce my main job to part time.

The end goal wouid be to sell the sensor rig as a finished product with a thurough user guide and have it be used by research teams all over the world with minimal support.


\subsection*{Possible Challenges}
I think the main challene with the product is that it might be that researchers often have very specific needs for their data collection, and the sensor rig might be to general to hit any specific need.
Striking the right balance between modularity and ease of use will be crucial if the sensor rig is to be successful.
The main way to solve thes is to have many different people use it during my PhD and get feedback on how the rig addapts to their needs.
Ideally I would buy a second sensor rig and have it be used by other research teams to get more feedback.

\subsection*{Commencialization}
A key advantage with the commercialization of the sensor rig is that it requires very little investment to get started. 
The rig is an assembly of off-the-shelf components and 3D printed parts coupled with software that has already been developed.

In the beginning it would be possible to order all the components after an order is placed, and then assemble the sensor rig in a couple of days.
This will imply some lead time, but should not be segificantly longer than the lead 
time of the components themselves.

In the beginning it would make most sense ordering the 3d printed parts from a 3d printing service, but if the demand is high enough it would make sense to invest in an indostrial SLA 3d printer to make the parts in house.
Becoming a certified reseller of the sensors and hardware used in the sensor rig would also make sense after a while if the demand is high enough.

\subsection*{Intelectual Property}
Intelectual property is not really a big concern for the sensor rig.
The value in buying it would be in the ease of use and the fact that it is a complete solution that does not require any development.
People willing to invest the time and effort to reverse engeneer the sensor rig would probably be able to make something similar themselves.

However, if I was to pursue commercialization I would seek advice from Hans-Christian Bloom or others at the TTO to see if there are any parts of the sensor rig that is worth patenting.
Also as he mentioned in his lecture, the value of a patent is not only in the patent itself, but in the fact that it makes it easier to get funding and to sell the product \cite{blomIntelectualProperty2024}.

\section*{Reflection Note on My Role}

\subsection*{Developer}
A natural role for me in the commercialization process would be as main developer and continue to developing the sensor rig.
Being the developer and main user of the sensor rig I have a unique understanding of both the product and the needs I face as a researcher in the field that would be hard to replace.
In the beginning of the design process I designed the sensor rig primarely to fit my own needs, but with a strong focus on making it easy to use for others as well.
The quote from Steve Jobs \say{People don't know what they want until you show it to them.} has to some extent been true as new users have given good feedback after been shown the design or used it themselves \cite{jobsInterviewSteveJobs1998}.
Now that the first prototype is developed and in use, I have started collecting feedback from other users and incorporating it in the design process to follow the principals of design thinking \cite{sorheimUnderstandingValueUsers2024}.
My process aims to follow with Kulkos notion of using prototypes to explore solutions and focus in the user experience \cite{kolkoDesignThinkingComes2015}.

\subsection*{Customer Interaction}

Beyond developing the sensor rig, I would also be responsible forcustomer support and handeling customer feedback.
This comes naturally from me developing the rig and knowing 

\subsection*{Team Leader}


\subsection*{My Limitations}

If I ever went for commercializing the sensor rig I would start by finding a partner with experience in entrepreneurship and commercialization.
From taking this course and participating in related seminars I have learned that entrepreneurship not only about developing the product itself, but how to make the innovation have an impact \cite{widdingWhatDoesIt2024}.
I might manage to commenrcialize the sensor rig myself, but to acheive a bigger impact and economic success I would need help.
Research and development is something I really like, but I lack the motivation for entrepreneurship I think is needed to make a product like the sensor rig very successful.
