\section{Network card support bracket}
A new support bracket was designed to support the network card.
Previously, the network card was solely mounted in the PCIe slot, which left it susceptible to mechanical strain.
The component is attached to the cooling assembly of the \jx system using and interface fit and is secured to the network card using an M2 screw, as depicted in Figure \ref{fig:network_card_support}.
The design of the support bracket was facilitated by having created a model of the network card based on caliper measurements and manufacturer-provided images as well as the available mechanical model of the \jx \cite{mucahittoygarNVIDIAJetsonAGX2019}.
