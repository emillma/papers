\section{Calibration}
Towards the conclusion of the \preproject, the plan was to perform calibration during the \master, as discussed in Section 8.3 of the \preproject.
The initial idea was to use existing tools such as Kalibr or one from the list of calibration tools compiled by Simon \cite{EthzaslKalibr2023}\cite{simonCameraCalibTools2023}.
However, due to the shift in focus towards real-time video processing with \gls{cuda} and \gls{gstreamer}, the calibration task was not prioritized.

Another contributing factor to the delay is the complaints from colleagues regarding the difficulty of using these calibration tools.
Consideration has been given to developing a new calibration suite based on the $\mathbf{SE_2(3)}$ group as a potential future research project to which I could contribute.
The $\mathbf{SE_2(3)}$ group is particularly suitable for describing how uncertainty propagates when the extended pose includes the state of an \gls{imu} \cite{barfootAssociatingUncertaintyThreeDimensional2014}.
I have gained experience in implementing the $\mathbf{SE_2(3)}$ group in \gls{symforce} through another project, and I have studied relevant topics such as Lie Theory for robotics and factor graph optimization.
However, as developing a calibration suite is a significant endeavor, it was mostly ignored in favor of other tasks during the \master.
