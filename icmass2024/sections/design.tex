\section{Single Human Operator}
Research vessels such, as Milliampere 2, are necessery to advance the field of \glspl{asv}.
They enable the collection of relevant data from full-scale experiments in the field, and can serve as test platforms to evaluate new autonomous technologies.
The downside with such vessels is that their complexity generally makes their utilization more time consuming, as multiple people generally are involved and experiments often require substantial preparation.
Single points of failure can also be a problem as they can take the whole vessel out of operation during maintenance.

With this in mind, we have designed a sensor rig that can be operated by a single person.
It is by no means a replacement for any research vessel, but it lowers the barrier for collecting relevant sensor data from the field, and can serve as a force multiplier for full-scale experiments involving other vessels.
