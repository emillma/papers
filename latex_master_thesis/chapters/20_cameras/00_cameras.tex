\chapter{Polarization Cameras}
\label{chap:cameras}
This chapter presents the special type of polarization cameras used, explains how they work, and why they are particularly well suited for detection in marine environments.
Furthermore, it covers how to interact with the \cams through their \gls{api} and how the network adapters have been configured to achieve reliable $2Gb/s$ throughput from the \cams.
