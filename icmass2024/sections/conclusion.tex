\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this paper we have presented a new portable sensor rig design we believe will make collecting sensor data in maritime environments significantly easier.

We currently only provide raw datasets from the sensor rig, as our calibration results needs further validation, but we plan to release a calibrated dataset with fused position estimates in the future.
