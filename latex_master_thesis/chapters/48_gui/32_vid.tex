\subsection{Video Page}
Within the \srgui, the \textit{Vid} page holds significant importance as it enables the viewing of camera output and adjustment of camera parameters.
This crucial functionality is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:gui_vid}.
Currently, the \srgui allows the adjustment of shutter speed and analog gain through the utilization of two sliders.
The values of these sliders are published to two topics in the \gls{pubsub} system as shown in Figure \ref{fig:pub_sub_graph}.
Adding other camera parameters to the \srgui, like color balance, is a simple task, but was not deemed necessary as they currently are kept constant during experiments.
